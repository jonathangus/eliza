        "Let's summarize the key points from above: - L2s save gas costs by moving tx processing offchain, and instead submit tx data to the L1 - L2s derive their final ordering from the ordering of the L1 - L2s submit proofs to the L1 to allow funds to be withdrawn from the L2 bridge",
        "OP proofs can take up to 7 days, while ZK proofs will usually take 1 day at most. Once the poof is verified on the L1, the L1 will update it's state of the L2. Bob can now withdraw their new ETH from the L2 back to the L1 as a result of this settlement.",
        "But what about settlement? Settlement is used to finalize the L1's view of the L2, allowing for bridge withdrawals. In our example, the L2 would submit a proof (OP or ZK) after several batches have been submitted. The proof type will determine how long it takes to finalize.",
        "The L2 then waits for more txs to come in to form a batch. The is then submitted to the L1 as part of a blob. Once the L1 finalizes, the L2 ordering is finalized. It's important to note that at this point, the swap tx is finalized on the L2 itself. The swap cannot be reverted.",
        'Lets say Bob swaps USDC for ETH on an L2. This tx is sent to the L2 where it is processed quickly. At this point the tx is "soft" confirmed. If you trust the L2 operator, you can treat this state as finalized. If you want stronger guarantees, you can wait for the L1 data batch.',
        "Summary so far: users submit txs to the L2 -&gt; txs are batched and sent to the L1 -&gt; L1 finalizes its ordering -&gt; L2 finalizes its ordering -&gt; L2 submits proof to the L1 to finalize state changes. This is all theoretical, so lets walk through a simple example.",
        'The proof finalizes a set of txs on the L2. Verifying proofs on the L1 is what we refer to as "settlement". Settlement is important because it allows users to withdraw their funds from the L2 bridge. Without proper settlement, a bad actor could steal funds from the bridge!',
        "The L1 has a contract that tracks the state of the L2. You can think of this as the L1's viewpoint of the L2. When a tx batch is submitted by the L2, it's telling the L1 that the L2 world has changed. The L2 will then send a proof to prove that the state change is correct.",
        "This is where we get into optimistic and zero-knowledge proofs. Optimistic (fraud) proofs use economic security while zk proofs use advanced cryptography. Both methods of proving are used with the tx data to prove to the L1 that the results computed by the L2 are correct.",
        "An important property of L2s is that they rely on the final ordering of L1 txs to derive their own final ordering. If the L1 were to re-org L2 data batch txs, the L2 itself would re-org. This is what we mean when we say L2s derive their state from the L1.",
        "Because only data is submitted to the L1, and data is very cheap, L2s are able to scale Ethereum's tx throughput. Depending on the type of txs being executed, L2s can theoretically process hundreds of more txs per second when compared to the L1. This is a huge boost.",
        'Notice that the L1 doesn\'t actually compute anything here - this is a key concept for rollups. The L1 only stores data as blobs (not in contract "storage"), rather than processing every tx. All the processing is done on the L2, which is cheaper/faster than the L1.',
        "L2s are built on the premise of cheap data with minimized compute on the L1. Users submit txs to the L2, where they're quickly processed and batched together. These batches are then compressed and sent as raw data to L1. The L1 then stores this data to be used later.",
        "Eth txs are particularly expensive due to Eth's constraints on block sizes. Because of this, there's a relatively small amount of compute and storage that can be done per block. However, data is very cheap. In fact, Eth added a separate system just for data - EIP-4844 blobs.",
        "Let's first start by going over how Ethereum (and other L1s) work. When a transaction is processed by a L1 chain, every node in the network must process it. Txs are priced based on how much compute, storage, and data is used (gas usage). Compute and storage cost a lot.",
        "By now you probably know that L2s are Ethereum's way of scaling. You've probably wondered why L2s are so cheap when compared to L1. Or maybe you've asked yourself what ZK/OP proofs are. This post will answer those questions and give you a base understanding of L2s.",

        "Runestones are set to go live at block 840,000 - the next halving. Right now there are pre-rune ordinals that have promised holders rune tokens once the protocol goes live. These collections have large market caps in anticipation of being some of the first Rune tokens launched.",
        "One of the main benefits of runes is that multiple rune balances can be stored on a single UTXO, whereas BRC-20s only allow for a single token declaration. This leads to the reduction of UTXOs in the network, which helps make running a Bitcoin node cheaper.",
        "It's important to emphasize that none of these UTXOs actually have any data from the viewpoint of the Bitcoin protocol. All of this is handled off-chain. You can think of UTXOs are vessels for tracking data off-chain - they're flags for tracking transfers between addresses.",
        "Here's how a rune transfer works between Bob and Alice: - Bob declares a runestone (message) that says he wants to send 25 tokens to Alice - Bob creates a txn with an input UTXO that contains 100 tokens - The txn creates two output UTXOs where Bob has 75 tokens and Alice has 25",
        "There are 3 possible actions for runes: etching, minting, and transferring. Etching is the process of creating the token and defining its properties (name, symbol, supply). Minting actually gives runes to people. Transferring moves runes between addresses.",
        "This is different from ordinals, which inscribe data in the witness section of a txn, which is larger than OP_RETURN (max size 80 bytes) and less efficient In both cases, data is not actually stored in a UTXO - it's up to offchain indexers to associate a UTXO with the right data",
        'In the runes protocol, messages are referred to as "runestones". Runestones contain info about different tokens - whether they\'re being etched (created), minted, or transferred. The runestone is embedded in the OP_RETURN section of a Bitcoin transaction.',
        "Some context on the rune protocol - it was created by the same person that invented the ordinal theory,  It's a minimal protocol to support fungible tokens (memecoins) and doesn't require a change to Bitcoin. All data is tracked offchain, similar to ordinals.",
        "The key takeaway is that certain UTXOs go into a tx, and different UTXOs come out. Runes are heavily based on UTXOs just like ordinals. Here's my ordinals thread if you need a quick refresher: UTXOs are used to track data for both runes and ordinals.",
        "Before we talk about the Rune protocol, let's review how Bitcoin's UTXO model works. When you transfer BTC, you're actually taking chunks of BTC, inputting it into a transaction, and receiving different chunks in return. Here's an example showing a transfer of 0.2 BTC:",
        "While this approach brought a form of fungible tokens to Bitcoin, it had several downsides including multiple txns to mint/transfer/claim, the creation of excessive UTXOs, and the ability to only transfer one token at a time.",
        "Historically, fungible tokens have not been possible on Bitcoin since it doesn't support smart contracts. However, with the advent of ordinals, we saw the rise of BRC-20s, which inscribed token data in individual SATs (satoshis) and were processed by off-chain indexers.",
        "To start, what are fungible tokens? These are tokens that are not unique in nature, can be divided, and are interchangeable. They exist on other blockchains as ERC20s on EVM chains or SPL on Solana. Examples include memecoins and governance tokens.",

        "There are several downsides to 3074 that we should be cognizant of. The biggest one is around invokers - these need to be fully audited, non-upgradeable, and trustless otherwise user's funds easily be stolen. Additionally, some existing reentrancy checks may not work with 3074.",
        "Unlock is asset recovery. A special invoker contract can be setup so it allows you to use social recovery to recover assets if you lose your private key. A signature can be submitted to the invoker to move assets around if social recovery conditions are met.",
        "Unlock is the ability to execute multiple actions in one tx. Right now in order to swap tokens on Uniswap, you have to first approve Uniswap to use your tokens, and then run the actual swap. Not great. With 3074, these two actions can be batched into a single tx.",
        "We get several unlocks from this new tx flow. Unlock is that transactions can be sponsored. Let's say Bob doesn't have any ETH in his wallet. Instead of needing to buy/bridge ETH, an app can front the gas for Bob's tx. This could be huge for gaining mass retail adoption.",
        "This is how the 3074 flow works: - User signs a message (off-chain, not a tx) - User or sponsor sends the message to an invoker contract as a tx - Invoker uses AUTH and AUTHCALL to verify and call each target contract with the user's address as the sender",
        "AUTH takes a user's signature and intended action, and verifies that it was signed properly. It sets a variable that states the originating address of the txn. AUTHCALL then calls the target contract(s) with the originator address as the caller rather than the actual msg.sender.",
        "So how can we turn existing EOAs into smart contracts? By adding two new opcodes (computer instructions) - AUTH and AUTHCALL. These two opcodes work in tandem to allow a smart contract to act on behalf of an EOA. Here's a quick overview on how they work (feel free to skip).",

        "It's important to note that the funding rate can fluctuate, and even go negative if sentiment shifts to bearish. In this case, Ethena has an insurance fund that can step in to make sure USDe is fully collateralized. Most of their venture money is going towards this fund.",
        "In the current environment, traders are bullish on ETH, which means the funding rate is positive. Long perps holders PAY short holders. Right now this rate is around 23% annualized, which Ethena accrues due to its short positions. This gives us 4% + 23% = 27% yield in total.",
        "Funding rates are used to keep perpetual contracts in line with the underlying asset's price. This is essentially a fee that perps traders need to pay based on the sentiment of the market. If more traders are bullish (have longs), they pay short traders a fee, and vice versa.",
        "Ethereum staking yield is well known and is the backbone for many defi protocols. The yield comes from a combination of consensus rewards, execution level fees (priority gas fees), and MEV block builder bids. As of now, the yield for staking Ethereum is about 4%.",
        "This leads us to staked USDe (sUSDe), which is Ethena's yield bearing bond. sUSDe yield comes from two places: - Yield from staked ETH - Funding rates from the short perps Remember that Ethena accepts staked ETH deposits and opens up a short perp position to offset the ETH.",

        "This isn't good for stablecoins because it would essentially track ETH's price movements. To hedge this position, Ethena shorts a perpetual contract of Ethereum of the same size as the deposit. This gives USDe an overall delta-neutral position against Ethereum's price.",
        "Here's a high level explanation of how that mechanism works. A user deposits staked ETH into Ethena. This gives USDe a positive delta on ETH, which basically means the price of the synthetic will move with positive correlation to the price of Ethereum.",
        "To understand where the 27% yield comes from, we first need to understand how USDe works. Rather than store a bunch of dollars at a bank (like USDC) to back each token 1:1, USDe uses a combination of Ethereum collateral and perpetual contracts to maintain its peg.",

        "Let's talk about what this standard brings to the table. There is a nice aspect of built in fractionalization. You can essentially trade this as both an ERC20 and ERC721 which is novel (large wicks are full NFT trades). I respect anyone willing to experiment in this space.",

        "You'll also see approve and transferFrom functions in this code. These are meant to adhere to the ERC20 and ERC721 standards, however the naming of different transfer/approval events collide, so the token ends up looking like a standard 721 contract to most indexers.",
        "Let's talk about the technicals for the next 3 tweets. Code here: You'll see that the contract has to store several mappings to track the owner of the NFTs, the fraction balance of each user, and which NFTs a user holds.",
        "Any time an NFT or fractions are traded, the ERC404 contract will check to burn or mint NFTs. Because there are multiple different balances and ownerships stored in ERC404, each transfer ends up being around 125k gas, which is more than double a standard NFT transfer.",
        "In order to own an NFT, you need to have at least 1 base unit (100 in our case) fractions. You can calculate the NFT balance of an address by doing floor(balanceOf[address] / baseUnits). If we had 138 fractions, we'd have 1 NFT. 199 fractions is also 1 NFT. 200 units = 2 NFTs.",
        "So far, not that different from before. But this is where it gets interesting. You can actually trade fractions of your NFT around. I can transfer 20 Fig NFT fractions to someone else. My balance will now be 80. However, because my balance is less than 100, I will lose the NFT.",
        "Now let's pretend our Figs are an ERC404 token. The fig contract now has a base unit like an ERC20 token. For this example, let's assume a base unit of 100 (in reality it'll be something like 10^18). Now if I mint a Fig NFT, my balance will be 100 instead of 1.",
        "Let's say we have an ERC721 NFT contract called Fantastic Figs. When you mint a Fig, your balance goes from 0 to 1. When you transfer your Fig to someone else, your balance goes to 0. You can't trade fractional parts of each NFT, it has to be whole tokens. Very straightforward.",

        "This brings us to Dymension. Dymension itself is a proof of stake Cosmos blockchain - it has its own validator set that builds and validates blocks, and a native token DYM used for staking. Dymension was designed specifically to be a settlement layer for app-specific rollups.",

        "One of the biggest differences between Farcaster and normal social apps is the concept of storage. On other social apps, you can post nearly-unlimited amount of content for free. On Farcaster, you need to rent storage units to send more messages to the protocol.",
        "There are 5 types of Farcaster messages. Casts are messages created by users (similar to tweets or reddit posts). When you \"tweet\" something in Warpcast, you're actually creating a Cast message. When you react to a cast, you're sending a reaction message to the protocol.",

        'Under the EigenLayer model, each AVS could be secured by the full stake of all Ethereum validators. This would be substantially harder to attack - all security is "pooled" together which means an attacker would need magnitudes more stake to take over any of the AVS\'s.',
        "Let's look at an Ethereum DApp that relies on multiple protocols. The security of the DApp is as strong as its weakest link. In the example below, we can see that an attack would only need to attack an AVS with $1B at stake rather than needing to attack Ethereum.",
        "Let's pause here and summarize: - Validators can pledge their existing stake to secure new protocols - Validators earn extra yield on the same capital - Devs build more secure protocols by tapping into the cryptoeconomic security of Ethereum",
        "Validators would need to weigh the capital cost of staking on the new AVS instead of staking on Ethereum or other protocols. 2) Protocols are able to tap into Ethereum's security. An AVS built on Eigen will be secured by the same validators that secure Ethereum.",
        "From a protocol (or actively validated service - AVS) perspective, there are several benefits. 1) It's much easier to bootstrap a set of validators. Previously, an AVS would need to go out and find validators willing to take their native token as a reward.",
        "Here's why this primitive is so powerful: From a validator's perspective, they're able to earn more yield on the same stake - ie. higher capital efficiency. The only costs are needing to run extra software and accepting slashing penalties for misbehavior.",
        'EigenLayer introduces the concept of "restaking", which allows Ethereum validators to re-use their existing stake (32 ETH) to secure other protocols. Validators will earn extra yield on their existing stake without needing to unstake or add more capital.',
        "However, Ethereum's security currently only extends to smart contracts. Protocols that operate outside of the EVM cannot leverage security provided by Ethereum validators. This is where EigenLayer comes in.",
        "This provides a lot of cryptoeconomic security - it would take massive amounts of ETH to attack Ethereum's consensus protocol. This makes smart contracts (programs) that run on the Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) very secure. Users can trust that contracts will work as expected.",

        'EIP-4844 is also called "proto-danksharding". This is a precursor to full danksharding (multi-year project), which is the endgame for Ethereum scaling. 4844 lays the groundwork for full sharding by introducing forward-compatible primitives that will be used in the future.',
        "Conversely, rollups moving to blob data should also reduce the gas prices on L1 for everything else. Right now, rollup calldata makes about ~20% of all L1 gas usage. By moving this all to data blob txns, less gas should be used per L1 block, leading to reduced gas prices.",
        "By shifting to blob-carrying txns, rollups will be less affected by L1 activity. For example, a very contentious NFT mint (a la Otherside) can spike standard L1 gas fees, but the blob fee market will not be affected. Rollup txns will not go up in price in this scenario.",
        "How will rollups use EIP-4844? As I mentioned earlier, rollups currently use Ethereum calldata to store txn data. Rollups can instead shift to using these data blobs to post txn data, which will be significantly cheaper. 4844 adds new precompiles so rollups can validate blobs.",
        "Blobs are cheaper to use than Ethereum calldata because the data never actually makes it to the EVM (only a commitment to the blob is). Additionally, because there's a separate fee market for blob gas, non-blob related activity on L1 won't spike gas fees for blob txns.",
        "How are blob gas fees calculated? Very similarly to how standard gas fees are calculated on L1 today. It uses a 1559-style pricing model where the price changes based on demand. More blobs = price increase, fewer blobs = price decrease.",
        "Each data blob can be up to 125kb in size, and up to 6 blobs can be added per block with a target of 3 blobs. This allows for a throughput of ~750kb/block. L1 blocks are currently capped at 1.875mb/block, with 4844 this theoretical capacity increases by ~40% to 2.625mb/block.",
        "Enter EIP-4844, which adds a new transaction type to the Ethereum protocol specifically for handling data blobs (chunk). These data blob txns are submitted to the beacon chain (consensus layer). The data blob is then saved by the beacon chain (2 weeks) but never sent to the EVM.",
        "Rollups still need to pay for the data posted onto mainnet - this cost is a function of how large the data blobs are and the current L1 gas price. This means that a spike in L1 gas prices will affect how much a rollup needs to pay, which affects how much L2 txns cost. Not great.",
        "Before we start, let's quickly review how rollups generally work. Rollups process large amounts of user txns quickly, batch/compress the txn data, and post the data blob to Ethereum mainnet in a txn. Rollups are cheap because all the compute is done on the rollup, and not on L1.",

        "The new œæ721 contract also allows you to wrap and unwrap CryptoPunks in bulk, a feature that the old wrapper did not have. You can also directly migrate Punks from the old wrapper to the new one, making it extremely simple to move over.",
        "The new flow looks like this: transfer Punk to Stash -&gt; call wrap function. The beauty of this is that Stash addresses are predetermined per user, so you can transfer the Punk before the Stash is even deployed. The wrap function will auto-deploy the Stash for you.",
        "Now with œæ721, the process for wrapping Punks is cheaper and less prone to errors. There's now a Stash contract that gets deployed on behalf of each user. Stashes actually contain quite a bit of extra logic that I'll dive into down the line.",
        "However, the old wrapped contract has some small issues. The old flow for wrapping a Punk involved: registering a proxy, transferring your Punk to that proxy, and then minting a wrapped version. The lack of atomicity (all in one txn) leads to more gas usage and more errors.",
        "That's why you've probably heard of wrapped CryptoPunks. This was a contract written in 2020 they allowed users to wrap their trustlessly Punks in an ERC721 token to make it easier to buy, sell, and trade their Punks.",

        "People are able to spam these txns because they're extremely cheap compared to smart contract txns. This has led to Arbitrum being taken down, and leading to degraded experience on other chains like zkSync and Avalanche. It remains to be seen when this craze will end.",
        "So why are these being spammed? It's probably driven by the desire to be early and recreate some of the success of BRC-20 tokens on other chains. However, a lot of these txns are just the same user/bot spamming small mints over and over again.",
        "Inscriptions also feel like taking a step backwards. The EVM was designed to support smart contract logic, inscriptions instead move all the computation off-chain. This leads to more fragmentation and trust in indexers. There's also basically 0 composability with inscriptions.",
        "The big downside is that there's a huge reliance on off-chain indexers. Yes, everyone can technically recreate the state of a token themselves, but it relies on indexers following the same set of protocol rules. The EVM on the other hand, enforces these rules for us.",
        "The other upside is that operations are very cheap. Smart contracts need to execute logic and store data on-chain. Inscriptions only involve sending calldata on-chain, which is much cheaper to do.",
        "So what's the benefit of these inscriptions? The first upside is that everything is completely on-chain. xRC-20 txns and NFT metadata is all stored on-chain and available for everyone to read. This is good because you only need to rely on the availability of the chain.",
        'Minting token involves sending a transaction to yourself with calldata that includes a "mint" op and the amount minted. Transferring tokens is similar except with a "transfer" op. Some protocols also emit events for this. There\'s a fair amount of discrepancy right now.',
        "It's up to off-chain indexers to interpret what an inscription token txn is doing. In this example we have an arbscription token (BEEG ticket) that's being minted for qty 1000. Off-chain indexers need to verify that the token exists and can be minted (not over-minted).",
        "The calldata needs to follow a specific format in order to qualify as an (x)RC-20 token. The interesting part about xRC-20 tokens is that none of the logic lives on-chain. Normally for ERC20 tokens, rules are enforced by smart contracts. Here, all the logic is handled off-chain.",
        "So what are people inscribing on EVM chains? Right now, it's mostly BRC-20 type tokens. BRC-20 tokens are tokens where the token data is stored in calldata (in JSON format) instead of in a smart contract. The calldata includes the token id, mint amount, and the operation.",
        "Calldata is optional data that can be sent in a transaction. Most of the time this data is used when passing inputs to smart contracts. It's also used for rollup data. Calldata is read-only and cheap to use, especially when compared to storing data in smart contract state.",
        "People then realized that they could do the same thing on Ethereum (and other EVM-based chains). Instead of inscribing data on individual SATs, EVM inscriptions inscribe data in transaction calldata. But what is calldata?",
        "The concept of Inscriptions started with Bitcoin's Ordinals. Ordinals allow data to be inscribed directly on chain - this can be text, images, videos, etc. This is the only way for BTC to add support for NFTs and other tokens since it doesn't support smart contracts.",

        "Previously, the \"from\" value was the attacker's address. Now it's the victim's address. The second critical part of the attack is that the victim had an old approval that allows the NFTTrader contract to transfer around the victim's BAYC NFTs.",
        "Now we go back to the original call context. The UniV3 NFT was just self-transferred, and the counter party (addressTwo) has been switched to the victim. We then go to the next NFT to be transferred - the BAYC in this case.",
        "Remember how the swap was originally a self-swap? The attacker uses editCounterPart to change the counter party to the victim's address. This is the first phase of the attack. The swap is now a swap between the attacker and the victim.",
        "The safeTransferFrom function is executed, which calls back into the attacker's contract with the victim's address. The malicious contract then calls the NFTTrader contract's editCounterPart function.",
        "safeTransferFrom is dangerous because it has a callback that's triggered after the transfer is done. This is what can lead to reentrancy attacks. In our specific case, the safeTransferFrom is also called with data - this is where the victim's address is embedded.",
        "After the swap intent is created, the attacker calls closeSwapIntent to initiate the transfer of assets. The first asset to be swapped is the UniV3 NFT. The source and destination addresses of the transfer are both the attacker's address here.",
        "The last important piece of info to note is that the swap includes an arbitrary NFT (a UniswapV3 LP position) alongside the actual stolen NFT. This might seem random, but it's used to conduct the reentrancy exploit. This random NFT is always the first NFT in the swap.",
        "The attacker also created the swap so that the receiver of the swap is also the attacker's address. Normally this value (addressTwo) should be the counter party (someone else). The result is that both of the swap's parties are the same address - it's a self-swap.",
        'The attack starts by calling the NFTTrader contract and creating a new "swap intent" (createSwapIntent). Normally two lists are provided - a list of tokens that the swapper wants to give up, and a list of tokens to be received. For this attack, the former list was empty.',

        "When this data is used by multicall, it first reads payload_1. Now, because the trusted forwarder sent this data, the TW contract goes through the ERC2771 flow which takes the last 20 bytes of data as the intended msg sender. This is where the exploit happens.",
        "Assume we have a multicall payload with 2 calls: [payload_1 | payload_2]. When a user sends this payload through the truster forwarder, the payload received by the ThirdWeb contract looks like: [payload_1 | payload_2 | address]. The last 20 bytes are the intended msg.sender.",
        "The exploit arises from the fact that ThirdWeb's contracts have a multicall function that allow multiple txns to be run inside a single txn. This is a common pattern used to save on gas, however it's usually not used in conjunction with ERC2771.",
        "The receiving contract, which inherits from ERC2771Context, has a _msgSender function which it uses instead of the typical msg.sender. If the forwarder calls the contract, _msgSender() looks at the last 20 bytes of the calldata to identify the intended message sender.",
        "Now for the more technical breakdown. We first have to understand how ERC2771 works. When a transaction is submitted from a trusted forwarder, the address of the intended msg.sender is appended to the transaction calldata.",

        '(Last context slide) ERC2771 is a standard that allows a "forwarder" contract to submit a txn on behalf of a user. This pattern is used for gasless txns - the user\'s gas costs are covered by a gas sponsor (the forwarder). Still with me?',

        "Some more resources to learn more about Ethereum PoS and Lido: - - - - - -",
        "Is Lido's 33% market share concerning? Depends on who you ask. Many will argue that there's smart contract risk and the Lido DAO has too much power. Others will say that Lido is following the incentives that are presented in Ethereum's design, and Lido is acting in good faith.",
        "Both of these scenarios are bad, but it takes a large amount of $LDO to control the vote, and dual governance should be implemented soon to allow stETH holders to veto proposals. This post from  does a great job breaking down all the possible attack vectors:",
        "Ok, so the 33% number isn't the end of the world, but what are the other risk vectors? $LDO holders could vote to upgrade the contracts, mint unlimited stETH, and take all the staked ETH. The DAO can also put in malicious node operators to try to censor transactions.",
        "and  do a great job breaking down the nuances of this attack vector in this podcast: I highly recommend taking a listen (especially at the linked time) to understand the consequences of Lido having a huge staked ETH marketshare.",
        "All of these attacks still require all Lido node operators to collude with each other. Additionally, these attacks can be coordinated with non-Lido validators as well - the Lido DAO cannot force collusion directly.",
        "This is pretty unlikely to happen given the attackers would be sabotaging themselves due to the slashed ETH. At 51% of the stake, operators could collude to start extracting MEV for themselves. At 67%, operators could fully halt the chain, which would require a fork to fix.",
        "A big concern with Lido having 1/3 marketshare is that all Lido node operators could in theory collude and halt the network. However, this would result in Lido's staked ETH being slashed and the network eventually recovering. stETH wouldn't be backed, but Ethereum would recover.",
        "So why is everyone worried about Lido having ~33% of all staked ETH? In proof of stake, if 33% of the validators acts maliciously or shut down, the chain stops finalizing. This is called an inactivity leak - rewards stop being issued and inactive validators are slashed.",
        "The DAO also governs over all the smart contracts in the Lido protocol. This includes setting fees, the allowed oracles, and handling contract upgrades. Note that the DAO cannot actually force node operators to do anything directly - it just controls which operators are allowed.",

        "Big shoutout to   and the rest of team for putting this public good together. It's done a great job of limiting the number of interactions ppl have needed to do with their cold wallets, keeping assets more secure.",

        "Revoking a delegation is also simple. Click on manage my profile and select the delegation you want to remove. Click submit and confirm the transaction. Your delegation will now be removed.",
        "Option 3 is very similar to Option 2. The only difference is you'll need to choose a token id to delegate for. For example, if your cold wallet owned id 5690, you'd fill out the box like below. Again, you'll need to submit and sign the txn with your cold wallet.",
        "You can then fill out delegate cash like below. Submit and sign the message. Your hot wallet will now be the delegate for your cold wallet specifically for the contract address you inputted below.",
        "For option 2, you'll need the hot wallet address and NFT contract address. The easiest way to get the contract address is by going to OS/Blur and finding the Etherscan link. Click on the link and copy the address from Etherscan.",
        "For all 3 options, your hot wallet needs to be connected to the site. Option 1 is the easiest to setup. You just enter your hot wallet address in the input box and click submit. You will then need to sign a message saying you want to delegate on your hardware wallet.",
        "1) Wallet - your hot wallet will do everything for ALL CONTRACTS on behalf of the cold wallet 2) Contract - your hot wallet will do everything for a SPECIFIC CONTRACT on behalf of the cold wallet 3) NFT - your hot wallet will act on behalf of the cold wallet for a SPECIFIC NFT ID",
        "Let's go over how to setup a delegate wallet now. For this example, I'll pretend like I have a Beanz NFT in my hardware wallet and I want to delegate a hot wallet to mint on its behalf. To start, go to You'll find 3 options on the top right.",
        "It's important to note that your NFTs NEVER leave your cold wallet when using delegate cash. If you want to learn more, I did a full thread on the ins and outs of that you can find here:",
        "With delegate cash, applications can see if the owner of the NFT has delegated another wallet to act on its behalf. For example, the owner of a BAYC can delegate their hot wallet to act on behalf of their vault to mint a future Yuga drop (used for Dookey Dash).",
        "However, if your NFT is in a hardware wallet, you'd either need to transact using the ledger directly (risk signing something bad) or you'd need to transfer the NFT to a hot wallet and back (txn fees). Neither scenario is ideal.",
        "Before getting started, let's talk about what  is. It's a decentralized repository that allows users to delegate (assign) a hot wallet to act on behalf of a cold wallet. This is useful because many NFT projects have mints/claims that are restricted to NFT owners.",
        "Delegate Cash is one of the best ways to keep your NFTs secure in a cold wallet while still allowing you to participate in gated mints using a hot wallet. With several upcoming mints having delegate support, now is a good time to walk through how setup a delegate wallet üßµ:",

        "I agree with this. I should've pushed for this in my contract review, so I'll take part of the blame. Definitely will ask for it next time. I did, however, add support in the  contract.",
        "Overall the contract should be quite gas efficient for the upcoming sale. Both the presale and auction mint functions were designed to be secure while also cutting down on gas costs that users need to pay. As a reminder, the sale will happen on June 27th. Good luck to everyone.",
        "All of these gas optimizations were added so the minter doesn't have to pay much in gas fees. The total gas consumption to mint a single NFT in the presale should be ~80k gas units, which be only be about 0.008 ETH even if gas prices spike up to 100 gwei.",
        "Lastly, I'll talk about the unchecked blocks added to the code. By default, Solidity will run extra checks to make sure values can't overflow/underflow. However, this uses extra gas. If we know for certain that math operations won't overflow/underflow, we can use unchecked.",
        "Next, you'll see a heavy dose of calldata usage for input parameters. I've been preaching this for a while, but if you have dynamic-length inputs that are read-only, using calldata instead of memory will save a decent amount of gas.",
        "The code also takes advantage of struct packing. This reduces gas by compacting smaller data types into a single storage slot. You'll see that PresaleInfo, AuctionInfo, and RedeemInfo are all squeezed into a single storage slot (&lt;= 256 bits), which cuts down on storage reads.",
        "The next big gas trick was to use a bitmap for denoting whether an Azuki id can claim a bean (in case they couldn't be airdropped one). Here's a thread I made on why this saves gas:",
        "We also took advantage of another ERC721A feature - auxiliary data storage. By hijacking already-used contract storage, the get/setAux functions allow us to store a user's auction mint count for less gas than a standard mapping.",
        "We added several gas optimizations to this contract. For starters, this contract is an ERC721A contract. For those unfamiliar, ERC721A was primarily built by Azuki,  and myself. It's a hyper-efficient NFT batch minting contract.",
        "One key difference is that the MysteryBean auctionMint function also requires that a signature is passed in. Again, this means you will have to mint from the Azuki website instead of the directly from contract. This should help prevent bots.",
        "The auction mint function (L373) is very similar to the original Azuki dutch auction code. It first makes sure a user hasn't minted past their wallet limit and that there is still supply remaining. It then calculates the current auction price and validates the msg.value.",
        "The Azuki backend will check how many Azukis/Beanz a user has and use that to generate a valid signature to be used in the contract. The contract itself will validate that the user hasn't minted more NFTs than they've been allocated or that the total supply is exceeded.",
        "If you go to line 258 in MysteryBean.sol, you'll find the presaleMint function. This function will be used for both Azuki and Beanz presale minting. In order to mint, you'll need a signature parameter which means you MUST mint from the Azuki website and not from the contract.",
        "Here's an official announcement regarding the mint details: So as we can see there are two presale phases and one public sale phase. Here's how the code for those functions work:",
        "For context,  wrote the contract while  and I audited the code and added in some gas optimizations. The contract can be found here: I will focus this thread on minting/gas optimizations, but I may do a full breakdown in the future.",
        "The  MysteryBean contract has been verified which means it's time to go through the code. Let's talk about how minting will work and the various gas optimizations that were added to reduce fees for users üßµ:",
        "Wouldn't really call this a fair comparison because 1) the initial mint was a dutch auction and 1 eth was the starting price 2) Azuki was a much less well known commodity back then. You can probably find a txn towards the end of the DA with much higher gas prices.",

        "Things like staking, borrowing, or lending NFTs are not currently possible with Ethscriptions. Additionally, there are very few (maybe only 1?) dApps that will actually render your Ethscriptions and properly handle them. If there's more traction this will change eventually.",
        "What are the disadvantages? Ethscriptions don't really do much. They're just blobs of data that exist on the blockchain. They can't be changed, there's no programability, and there's a limit to the metadata size. The only thing you can really do at current time is trade these.",
        "This leads into the second advantage - everything is fully on-chain. As long Ethereum calldata is persisted, these Ethscriptions will be available. Very few existing Eth NFTs are fully on-chain, most stored their data on IPFS or centralized servers.",
        "What are advantages of Ethscriptions? They're can be cheaper to mint than standard ETH NFTs depending on the data size. The total gas usage for a Punk ethscription is 26k units while the same standard NFT would be ~100k units without the metadata even being on-chain.",
        "Applications need to add specific support for Ethscriptions. This means they need to read calldata directly instead of reading from a smart contract like they do for standard ETH NFTs. There are also a couple rules that they must follow to properly adhere to the standard:",
        "If you want to see what this image looks like, you can just copy base the calldata and paste it into your browser. You should see an image of a punk (you probably need to zoom in). As we can see, this txn literally encoded an image into the Ethereum calldata.",
        'Here\'s an example of an Ethscription being created: Scroll down and find the section labeled "input data". This is the calldata that stores the Ethscription. Click on "View Input As" and select UTF-8. You should see the base64 encoding as such:',
        "Ethscriptions are just chunks of calldata that store images or text. How exactly can images be stored? By using something called base64 encoding. I won't go into the details on base64, but you can think of it as a way of representing various data types with hex characters.",
        "The reason for this is that smart contracts cannot read from calldata (unless it's the input to one of its own functions). However, off-chain entities can read from calldata because it's part of the blockchain's history. This is the basis behind Ethscriptions (and rollups).",
        "The EVM processes user transactions and also stores a lot of data. This includes persistent contract data (storage), temporary contract data (memory), and transaction input data (calldata). Both storage and calldata can be permanent, but calldata is a lot cheaper to use.",
        'You can think of the Ethereum blockchain as a super computer (in reality it\'s actually many computers, hence the "distributed network"). This computer runs an operating system call the Ethereum Virtual Machine, or EVM.',

        "Another upside to NFT-bound wallets is that transferring entire sets of NFTs becomes a lot cheaper gas-wise. Let's say you wanted to buy an entire Yuga set. Instead of buying individual NFTs, you'll be able to buy an entire Yuga NFT wallet in one transaction, saving on txn fees.",
        "Developers will also be able to use 6551 to update metadata dynamically to reflect the tokens that the NFT owns. For example, an avatar NFT could change appearances if it were to own certain clothing or shoe NFT items (RTFKT/Adidas could leverage this).",
        "In a similar fashion, NFT gaming assets will become more advanced. You can have character skins that receive NFTs to enhance abilities/cosmetics. Even if the skin was transferred, it wouldn't lose it's enhancements because the skin itself owns the NFTs.",
        "This is because the POAP is bounded to the old owner's wallet. However, with 6551, the project can mint the POAP to the NFT's token bounded account directly. Now, even if the NFT is sold, it'll still hold the POAP and thus be eligible for the airdrop..",
        "Here's an example: let's say an NFT project does an IRL event with an activation that mints a POAP to a wallet. If you have the NFT and the POAP you're eligible for a future airdrop. Previously, if you sold the NFT, then it would never get the airdrop.",
        "With 6651, you'll be able to build these groupings on-chain for any set of NFTs. Projects can use this to create more complex and user-friendly staking/loyalty systems because they can now see the NFT's transaction history and what assets are grouped together.",
        "With ERC6551, on-chain identities will evolve. You'll be able to section your wallet into multiple profiles by having one NFT own related NFTs (ex. a BAYC owning a MAYC and BAKC). We already see this concept in  collectors profile and  crews.",
        "Up until recently, NFTs have been treated as singular static entities. They might be PFPs, gaming assets, membership passes, or pieces of art. However, they haven't been dynamic. Once an NFT has been minted, it doesn't really change - at best you might see a metadata update.",
        "If you missed my thread on how ERC6551 works, you can find it here:",
        "I recently went over how ERC6551 (Token Bound Accounts) works under the hood. So now let's talk about how ERC6551 will change the ways NFTs are used üßµ:",

        "It'd be the same as a multi-sig. Essentially the owner of the NFT that controls the wallet would need to initiate a txn",
        "This is doable and something that I've heard recent projects consider. It would come at the cost of mutable metadata which is something to consider.",
        "I hope you found this post insightful, but also easy to understand. I will post a thread soon on various use cases of ERC6551 token-bound accounts, so stay tuned. And yes, the image in the OP is possible. A Kevin-wallet could own all of those NFTs. I hope one day this happens.",
        "So the TLDR is: ERC6551 enables all NFTs to own wallets by using a registry and smart contract wallets. The registry creates the wallet contracts and maps each wallet to an NFT. The wallet contract can own other assets. Only the owner of the NFT can execute txns on this wallet.",
        "Opensea is also currently working on ERC6551 support. Here's an example token bound wallet if you're curious:",
        "Here are some other great resources on ERC6551: - EIP: - Release blog: - Twitter account: - 6551 author:",
        "So what makes these NFT-bound wallets special? When the owner of the controlling NFT changes, so does the control of the wallet. Control of the NFT means you control everything in the NFT-bound wallet. NFTs will go from singular assets to bundles of assets.",
        "I want to reiterate that these NFT-bound wallets are smart contracts. They're similar to multi-sigs in that someone has to call a function on the contract in order for the wallet to do something. For 6551 wallets, the NFT owner will call executeCall on the wallet to start a txn.",
        "Ok so we have a registry that creates wallets for NFTs and maps them together. Now what? This NFT-bound wallet can now be used as a normal wallet. This wallet can transfer ETH, purchase NFTs, or swap ERC20 tokens around. The owner of the NFT has to initiate all the txns.",
        "For example, Azuki may map to a smart contract wallet that lives at address 0x243F4E0d556EFD1006c52E85A6ddFb6748A4C0b7. A single NFT may control more than one contract account, however, each contract account only belongs to a single NFT. Here's a complete diagram:",
        "If you're not familiar with registries, you can think of them as single smart contracts that store info. The ERC6551 registry has info that states what NFTs map to what smart contract wallets. It also creates the smart contract wallets using proxies (not that important to know).",
        "The answer is: a registry + contract wallets. A smart contract wallet is just a smart contract that can receive NFTs, ERC20s, or ETH and additionally execute arbitrary transactions. These contract wallets all have their own address (like all smart contracts).",
        "Most NFT contracts are this simple. As we can see above, there's no code that allows these NFTs to own other NFTs, ETH, or ERC20 tokens. Smart contracts can't be changed, so how does ERC6551 enable ANY NFT to own other assets?",
        "When you mint an NFT, you're just setting the owner value of the data entry. When you transfer an NFT, you're just changing the owner value. Balances are also updated. I've highlighted where the ownership setting happens in an ERC721 contract:",

        "The refund function (which isn't used yet), is pretty similar to reserve. It first validates that the signature is valid - this signature contains info on how many captainz a user won (L102). The code then calculates how many refunds should be made and then sends it to the user.",

        "Instead, the backend creates a signature that includes the max number of reservations per address. Users cannot change the max amount (L68) otherwise the signature validation will fail. Cost effective, but cuts down a bit of decentralization since a backend api is necessary.",
        "The 2nd part (action) is a clever way of restricting max reservations off-chain. The on-chain method of limiting max-reservations is to store a mapping of how many each user can make. However, populating this list for thousands of addresses is expensive.",
        "To break it down further, let's look at checkValidity on line 49. We can see that the signature requires the msg.sender as well as the max number of reservations. The 1st part (msg.sender) prevents multiple addresses from using the same signature.",
        "The first function to look at is reserve(). It validates that the inputs are correct (L71-73) and then ensures the signature passed in is valid (L74-77). This signature validation is key - it prevents arbitrary users from reserving tokens, and makes sure users can't over-reserve.",

        "It's interesting to note that the ownership check is not done after the position is created. This means that anyone can add to an already-established stake. This may be an issue if an ape is sold and the original owner continues to add to the stake position unknowingly.",

        "Here's another good overview on ERC20 tokens: Here's a good library to implement your first ERC20 smart contract: Here's the WETH contract:",
        "So in summary, ERC20 tokens are just fungible tokens. You can think of them similar to currencies, they can be exchanged, fractionalized, and swapped. They're important because they allow us to represent various assets on the Ethereum chain and unlock features that ether cannot.",
        "ERC20 tokens are also quite common as staking rewards. You'll often see ERC20 tokens give as rewards in Defi protocols or crypto games. To swap ERC20 tokens you can use Uniswap or other decentralized exchanges.",
        "The only way regular ETH can be transferred from your balance is if you initiate a transaction and send ETH with it. With WETH on the other hand, a pre-approved contract can withdraw from your balance. This enables all sorts of functionality to be built compared to ETH.",
        "The reason why you'd use WETH is it allows you to approve a 3rd party to withdraw a certain amount of funds from your balance ahead of time. This is useful for NFT marketplace bids being accepted. It's important to note that a 3rd party cannot withdraw regular ETH from you.",
        "WETH is one of the most common tokens you'll see in the NFT space. WETH is an ERC20 version of Ether. It maps 1:1 to Ether, if you deposit 2 ETH into the WETH ERC20 contract, you'll get 2 WETH back. If you deposit 2 WETH into the contract, you'll get 2 ETH back.",
        "What are some examples of ERC20 tokens? - WETH - USDC - ApeCoin - WBTC - UNI - Many more",
        "As you can see, the functions in the ERC20 interface are conducive to creating a token that can be used as a currency. You can have fractional amounts, you can allow a 3rd party to spend a portion of your balance, and you can easily transfer them around.",
        "You might notice that many of these functions are similar or the same as ERC721. However, notice the decimals() and allowance() functions. These are different. Decimals are used for display purposes and allowance says how much a user is allowed to spend.",
        "Remember my post about interfaces? ERC20 is the same as any other ERC interface in that a smart contract must implement a specific set of functions to be considered an ERC20 token. Here are the functions and events:",
        'In simple terms, an ERC20 token is a "fungible" token. How is this different from a "nonfungible" token? Every ERC20 token is exactly the same - there are no unique traits to any of them. You can trade one for another and you wouldn\'t see a difference. The value is the same.',
        "If you haven't already, check out one of my previous threads on what exactly an ERC is: The full EIP20 specification can be found here:",
        "Cygaar's helpful threads What exactly is an ERC20 token? You've probably heard this term thrown around a lot. You've probably also heard of WETH. Let's go over what these words mean in simple terms so you gain a better understanding üßµ:",
        "I haven‚Äôt read through the code, but with contracts of this magnitude, I would always always err on the side of caution and recommend and audit/bug bounty program. The last thing you want is an uncaught exploit and some malicious actor using it take away your apecoin.",
        "Ayo   no custom errors here?",
        "Yes, but there are better ways to prevent a reentrancy attack like  mentioned. Sometimes you have legit reasons for another contract to interact with your contract.",
        "I‚Äôm in the credits section",
        "Yeah, I helped with the whitepaper:",
        "To summarize: always be sure to check potential reentrancy exploits in your code. It's very easy to miss on a quick glance. I hope the thread above deepens your understanding of how a reentrancy attack works and helps you prevent them in the future.",
        "The gas costs of this solution are higher than my previous solution, but it still passes the threshold of the challenge. I found this solution to be more fun than the other, but less practical. Here's the full code:",
        "I won't go too in depth here, but line 46 is where we deploy the second contract. Then on line 33, you can see the recursive call we make back to NotRareToken - this is the reentrancy attack. The rest of the logic is focused on reducing storage writes which is less important.",
        "We can get around this by having our attacking contract deploy another contract to call mint() on NotRareToken. Here's what the full code looks like:",
        "In order for the callback function (onERC721Received) to be triggered, the caller of mint() must be a contract. However, if you make a call to mint() from a constructor, it won't actually register as a contract. More info here:",
        "In this challenge, notice how NotRareToken uses _safeMint with no reentrancy guard. This means that our attacking contract can call mint() in a recursive manner, allowing us to mint 150 tokens in one go. But before we do that we need to add some extra code.",
        "To prevent reentrancy attacks you can use a reentrancy guard or ensure that state changes happen in a way that a recursive call could never do harm. You can also use _mint which doesn't call a callback function. This article explains this in depth:",
        "Notice how a call to the onERC721Received function in the calling contract is made: Within this callback function, a malicious actor can do whatever they want to do, including calling the original contract again.",
        "In the case of NFT contracts, you'll often see a function called _safeMint. _safeMint differs from the normal _mint function by calling a hook after minting to ensure that a contract that is minting acknowledges that it must support ownership of NFTs:",
        "Reentrancy attacks happen when a function in Contract A makes a call to Contract B. Contract B then recursively calls Contract A, and normally takes advantage of the state not changing. A good explanation of how it works and past exploits:",
        "If you haven't done so already, I'd recommend reading part 1: This goes over a more optimal approach to the problem. The solution I'm showing you here takes advantage of a reentrancy loophole.",
        "I'm gonna break down an alternative solution to the latest  challenge. This approach demonstrates a very common smart contract exploit that all NFT developers should be aware of - reentrancy attacks. Let's go step by step into how this attack works üßµ:",
        "The solution I posted is not gonna win anything lol",
        "Use it when you‚Äôre certain there‚Äôs no risk of underflow/overflow. It works in this contract because we know we are incrementing the balance by at most 150",
        "If you liked this post or found it helpful, give it a like/RT: I post a lot of content similar to this, so feel free to give me a follow as well ü´°.",
        "So in summary, be careful with how you structure your writes in the EVM. Going from 0 to a non-zero value is much more expensive than going from non-zero to non-zero. Huge huge shoutout to  whom I worked with this challenge on. Give him a follow.",
        "We can do some more optimizations with this code: merge everything into one loop with an offset and throw everything into an unchecked block. This saves 23k gas. This works because the balance of the owner never goes down to 0 since we have a one-off mint on line 7.",
        "Crazy how a simple change can dramatically affect gas usage. This is why it's very important to understand the gas costs of the common opcodes in the EVM.",
        "And with this change, we've shaved off 1.3M gas and beaten our threshold. The reason this works is because we are avoiding multiple 0 to 1 storage writes. Every call to mint() after the first is a non-zero to non-zero write which is much cheaper than a 0 to 1 write.",
        "This means that every iteration through the for-loop will incur the expensive 0 to 1 storage write (SSTORE). Not ideal, so how can we fix this? We can mint everything first and then transfer the tokens after like this:",
        "In our specific example, there is a balances mapping in ERC721: When we mint the first time, we increase the balance of an owner from 0 to 1. When we transfer the token from the owner (line 8), we change the value from 1 back to 0.",
        "This chart breaks down the gas costs for various storage opcodes. Notice how going from 0 to 1 costs ~20k while 1 to 2 (or any non-zero) costs at most 5k. Here's the full article:",
        "However this approach uses 700k more gas than the maximum threshold. Why? This is the core concept that everyone should understand: storage writes from a zero value (default value) to a non-zero value are expensive compared to non-zero to non-zero writes.",
        "Now we know where to start so we can write the code to mint 150 tokens as such:",
        "Before we can do that, we need to identify which token we're minting first. Otherwise we don't know which tokenId to call transferFrom (ERC721) on. We can accomplish this by getting the balance of the first token holder:",
        "We start with an empty contract and want to use this contract to mint from the NotRareToken (NRT) collection. The first approach that comes to mind is looping 150 times, calling mint(), and transferring the token back to the caller in each iteration.",
        "Here's the challenge: The goal is to mint 150 NFTs in an efficient manner. There are a couple ways to do this challenge: I did it using a reentrancy attack and a simple loop. I'll go over the 2nd method since it's more efficient and simpler.",
        "Time to breakdown another gas optimization challenge courtesy of  This one focuses on a core concept that every EVM/Solidity engineer should be familiar with. Let's dive in (warning: spoilers ahead) üßµ",

        "Yeah I would say it's still a Bored Ape, it just doesn't come with anything outside of the art.",
        "Interesting thought experiment: let's say you have a Bored Ape worth 75 ETH. If you were to split it into two different NFTs, one which is purely the artwork and one that acts as a membership pass with no art (access to airdrops, events, etc), how much would each NFT be worth?",

        "Lines 24-27 contain the logic for the owner to withdraw funds after the sale is complete. Notice how there's an onlyOwner modifier here. This means that only the project owner can withdraw (which is expected).",
        "In many contracts, you'll see multiple mint functions - one for allowlist, one for public, etc. The only difference between these functions is normally the input validation (are you allowlisted, what phase of the sale is going on, how much supply is left).",

        "Lines 17-22 is where the magic happens. This is the user-facing mint function, where the sale actually happens. In our example, we verify the start time, supply, and payment amount here (18-20). Then on line 21, we actually mint the tokens to the user.",
        "Line 13 is the constructor. This is where you define the name of the token as well as its symbol. You'll define your immutable values here since they are initialized at deploy time. This is also a good time to initialize storage values.",
        "Lines 8-10 define specific sale/collection settings. You will often set a max supply as a constant value since you don't want it to ever change. The price and start time are also often constant values, but there are many cases where these need to be mutable.",

        "Going back the concept of trustlessness, a smart contract can only be trustless if it can be verified easily. With the left contract, anyone can read the code, see what it does, and understand exactly how it behaves. It's hard to do the same with the right contract.",
        "Once verified, the smart contract's readable form will be viewable by all. Here's a comparison of verified vs unverified code on Etherscan. On the right, you can read the code, on the left you only see the bytecode.",
        "Verification is the process of comparing the high-level code to the deployed bytecode to make sure there are no differences. Developers can verify their contracts using a tool (Etherscan, Tenderly) which will validate the dev's uploaded code against the deployed blockchain code.",

        "The Punks contract also omits the approve function from ERC20. This is because it didn't make sense for a spender to have approval over a certain \"amount\" of tokens. Looking at the 721 spec, you'll see that the approve function takes a tokenId instead of an amount.",
        "Let's take a look at the ERC721 standard (published Jan 24, 2018): specifically the transferFrom function. Notice how it takes in a to/from address and a tokenId. Very similar to what CryptoPunks did.",

        "Moving on to gas improvements: They should not be using uint32 anywhere except for struct packing. The EVM stores everything in 32 byte storage slots, so the conversion to uint32 (8 bytes) costs more gas. Here's a good read:",

        "The mint of one token was 115k gas units which is good considering the extra storage write done to prevent duplicate dreamer mints.",
        "I actually only have one main suggestion here, and that would be to use custom solidity errors to reduce deployment costs. They probably could've saved a small amount of gas using &lt; instead of &lt;= in some places, but overall not much else to critique on.",

        "There are several other improvements that could've been made to the contract, including using _mint over _safeMint, using v4 of 721A, and removing unneeded imports, but I won't dive too deep into those for this review.",
        "The signature also could've included the AL count, and the api to fetch a user's signature could've been set to return a pre-computed mapping of addresses to signatures. Lots of ways to prevent the exploit, this is why you should always have someone review your code.",
        "How could this be prevented? There needed to be a mechanism to map an address to the number of allocated AL spots. This can be done using a map or a merkle tree where the leaf hashes include the AL count.",

        "We switched from using structs to packing uints. Underneath, the actual bytes stored by both methods is the same, but with uint packing we're able to write many parts of the packing in assembly. This reduces overhead and lowers gas costs of several of our functions.",

        "We also implemented Diamond storage for ERC721AUpgradeable. This will make 721A diamonds compatible going forward which is huge because more and more contracts will be upgradeable in the future. Thanks to  for coming up with the EIP and helping us add it to 721A.",
        "Now that we no longer rely on OZ, we're able to make changes at will without worrying about breaking compatibility. This also gives 721A distinction as its own ERC721 library and not an extension on top of OZ's implementation.",

        "This is why we brought on Vectorized cause my documentation is awful ü´†",
        "So in summary, the Wyvern protocol handles order matching for Opensea for now. It requests approval to transfer your NFTs and wETH so it can automatically swap assets when a sale is made. In the near future, OS will be using their own Seaport protocol which I will look at soon.",
        "The NFT is then transferred to the buyer (since the seller gave approval to Wyvern to transfer tokens). The executeFundsTransfer function will also handle creator/marketplace fees.",
        "executeFundsTransfer will handle the actual swap of payment for NFT. If the payment is in ETH, the contract looks at msg.value and transfers the payment. If it's done in wETH, then the tokens are transferred to the seller (since Wyvern has approval).",
        "You'll find that approving the NFT for sale calls setApprovalForAll which gives Wyvern the ability to transfer your NFTs. When a sale is made, Opensea will call the atomicMatch function in Wyvern. atomicMatch will run a set of validations and then call executeFundsTransfer.",
        "Full documentation of the non-fungible (721) token standard can be found here:",
        "How does the transfer of the NFT actually happen? Well when you go to sell an NFT of a collection for the first time, you'll notice that you have to first approve the NFT for sale. The ERC721 standard dictates that all nonfungible tokens have an approval process.",
        "If the sale is buy-side (non-bid), wETH isn't needed because the buyer is the one initiating the sale. They're able to send ETH directly in the purchase transaction.",
        "However, Wyvern can take wETH from the bidder's account because the bidder gave approval to Wyvern to spend wETH when first making the bid (this is the ERC20 approval from above). Wyvern is able to use wETH as payment to the seller of the NFT.",
        "Wyvern now has the ability to spend wETH but why use wETH over ETH for bids? When a bid is accepted, a seller is initiating a transfer (sell-side) and is expecting payment. Contracts don't have the ability to take ETH out of an account ahead of time - Wyvern can't withdraw ETH.",
        "For Opensea, you'll notice an approval txn to spend wETH (an ERC20 token) to the WyvernTokenTransferProxy contract. For simplicity sake, think of this as giving the Wyvern protocol access to spend your wETH. The actual implementation of this is done with upgradeable contracts.",
        "Part of the ERC20 standard dictates that the contract has an approve function. This function gives approval for a given address to spend a given amount of that ERC20 token. Full documentation can be found here:",
        "Before going further, we need to understand what an ERC20 token is. ERC20 is an ethereum standard for fungible tokens. If a smart contract conforms to this standard, it can create a valid ERC20 token that any other smart contract can understand. Examples include wETH and apecoin.",
        "In the near future, Opensea will be moving to their own Seaport protocol which they announced a couple of days ago. But for now, order matching is done using the Wyvern Protocol.",
        "Opensea currently utilizes an open source protocol called Wyvern Protocol to handle order matching: They're using v2 of this protocol which can be found here: Whenever you buy/sell NFTs on OS, you'll see Wyvern as the contract.",
        'Ever wonder why why you need to put up wETH for  bids instead of plain ETH? Have you asked yourself what exactly "Wyvern Exchange" is? I\'m gonna give a high level overview on how the current OS order matching works before doing a deep dive on Seaport. üßµ:',

        "A couple of small gas optimizations: - Use ++i instead of i++ - Can also put i++ in an unchecked block - Use _mint instead of _safeMint, there's no need to check if a contract received the dooplicator here",
        "I also noticed they used the _burn function from 721A - haven't seen too many contracts use this yet, but it's great to see usage here.",
        "To actually read/write the claim status, you can do some simple bit shifting to find the relevant bit for a tokenId. This is what lines 48-51 are doing. This is just a general overview of bit shifting (which we now use in ERC721A), there are plenty of great resources online.",
        "You only need 1 bit to represent a logical boolean because there are two possible values. Solidity booleans however take up 1 byte (8 bits) of storage. We can use the individual bits across 40 integers (total of 40 * 256 = 10240) to denote the claim status of each doodle.",
        "The first thing I noticed was: uint256[40] claimedBitMap. Instead of using a size 10k boolean array (which is 80k bits), they're able to use some bit shifting to encompass all this data in just 10k bits. How does this work?",

        "In general &lt; is cheaper than &lt;=, so a line like require(quantity &lt;= 2) can be rewritten as require(quantity &lt; 3).",
        "In the signature check this line bytes32(uint256(uint160(msg.sender))) is unnecessary and wastes gas doing extra casting. None of the casting is necessary here since abi.encodePacked can concat address types.",

        "Looking at the TokenBatchPriceData struct, there's a uint8 for quantityMinted which provides no benefit over the original uin128. The point of using smaller integers than uin256 is to pack structs together so more vars can fit in one storage slot (32 bytes).",
        "Let's start with some variable naming: There are several vars (DA_STARTING_TIMESTAMP, DA_FINAL_PRICE, BASE_URI) that shouldn't be all-caps bc they aren't constants: Not a big deal, but I like consistent naming in my code.",

        'If you dig through the etherscan transactions list on the contract, you\'ll see that most transactions are on the method "0x8df9da46" instead of "mint_approved". This is just people using the exploit and sending hex data directly.',

        "The goal of this info is to validate that the txn was signed by the mint site and that the user is whitelisted. The verify function in dusty.sol does a standard signature verification, but it's missing one CRITICAL component: there's no check that info.from == msg.sender.",

        "Overall the biggest culprit here was bulk minting with ERC721. The tradeoff for using 721A is that transfers cost a bit more later, but we can see that users pay exorbitant gas prices during mint time (was seeing 4k at some point) which leads to the most loss.",
        "Some other smaller gas optimizations: - Use &lt; instead of &lt;= - Initialize uint256 index = 0; as uint256 index; - Use unchecked blocks where overflow/undeflow cannot occur",
        "More on _incrementTokenMintCounter: In practice, restricting mints per wallet doesn't do much. It's easily to mint from multiple wallets to get around this. I don't think it was super necessary to introduce this extra write, but I get the intention.",
        "Moving on to this function: _incrementTokenMintCounter This function is called before calling _safeMint, so if the txn fails during the mint call, we waste gas to write to storage. It can be called after _safeMint because we have a reentrancy guard.",
        "Let's look at the actual contract: The first thing that jumps out to me is the bulk minting logic. We've gone over this many times, but bulk minting via ERC721 is expensive because you write to storage for every token. This is exactly why ERC721A was developed.",
        "Overall it seems like this project could've been setup as an ERC1155 token instead of ERC721. 1155 is ideal for projects where the actual art/metadata doesn't matter much and you're looking to group tokens together. A perfect use case is for memberships, which this project is.",

        "4. Specialization Because of the decoupling of functionality, each layer can specialize in one or many of the core functions of a blockchain.",
        "Rollups on Celestia are effectively self-sovereign blockchains, enabling every application, community, and DAO to have its own sovereign execution space, while inheriting the security of the underlying consensus and data availability layer.",
        "For example, a DAO on a monolithic blockchain is not sovereign because it derives its authority from a different community, which might be the social consensus of a network like Ethereum.",
        "3. Sovereignty Applications on monolithic L1s are bound by the social consensus of that community and protocol, because their application is running on the same blockchain as everyone else.",
        "You can fork, deploy, or modify and deploy rollups like Starknet or Optimism or the Cosmos SDK. In the modular paradigm you are not restricted to any specific virtual machine, and instead have the freedom to experiment with and then choose the ideal execution environment.",
        "For example,  is building an execution layer built specifically to leverage the additional bandwidth enabled by a modular architecture as well as innovations like parallel transaction execution.",
        "Because of this, a faster pace of innovation is enabled at the VM layer, allowing developers to create and experiment with a wide array of VMs across various aspects of the execution environment. There is already experimentation happening in this space.",
        "This means that there are less constraints around both the execution environments that can be deployed to Celestia as well as the base layer to which they are deployed.",
        "2. Experimentation Rollups on Celestia don‚Äôt have to be designed to be interpretable by any specific virtual machine, like the EVM.",
        "Because validators don‚Äôt have to verify transactions in the block, just order them, so it‚Äôs much cheaper to increase block size.",
        "Modularity also allows separation of the consensus and data availability layer. Validators can just focus on ordering transactions, not on verification because verification is left up to the execution environments (rollups).",
        "As the number of Celestia light nodes contributing to the data availability of the network increases, the size of each block can also increase without compromising on security or scalability. Larger blocks result in more data throughput and therefore more scale.",
        "A key innovation of Celestia is that it enables light clients to achieve nearly the same security guarantees of full nodes through what‚Äôs known as a data availability sampling.",
        "More specifically, the calculation can be thought of as transactions per second divided by the cost for users to verify that all the transactions in the chain are valid. This verification is done by users running their own nodes.",
        "We might talk about the throughput of an API, or the number of transactions or queries per second a database can handle without affecting performance. In a decentralized application, you also need to take into consideration the verification of the data.",
        "1. Scalability When we talk about scalability in the traditional tech stack, it typically refers to the ability of an application or infrastructure to function well during a non-trivial increase (and subsequent decrease) in usage.",
        "The modular approach not only improves the scalability of the network, it also enables a handful of other properties and benefits. Let‚Äôs walk through some of them:",
        "Blockchain architectures until recently have been monolithic, meaning they were responsible for all core functions of a blockchain. Modular architectures separate the layers of the blockchain - consensus, data availability, settlement, and execution.",
        "Instead of deploying your application to the same blockchain as everyone else, you can deploy your own chain while still leveraging the same consensus layer so it can also share block space and security. This functionality is facilitated by modular architectures.",
        "Like the cloud gives you your own virtual machine, modular blockchains enable you to create your own blockchain in the form of an optimistic or zk rollup.",
        "Web3 and blockchain architectures are evolving in a similar direction, with the idea of application-specific blockchains gaining in popularity.",
        "These VMs give developers full control over their execution environment, allow them to install anything they want, and offer the same benefits as a physical server with the added benefit of never having to maintain or buy any actual hardware, giving the best of both worlds.",
        "In addition to that, it's become clear that this type of monolithic architecture is inherently not scalable. Virtual machines and cloud computing were the next big innovation in web infrastructure, and forever changed the way applications were built.",
        "But they were still restricted by the limitations of having a shared blockchain, had to use the Ethereum virtual machine, and had to follow along with any hard forks that were happening on Ethereum.",
        "This allowed developers to experiment and build decentralized applications in ways they could not have in the past, and was a powerful innovation.",
        'You can think of "shared hosting" like the execution environment given to you by Ethereum and the EVM. Ethereum was revolutionary in that it allowed application developers to build a unique application, then upload it to and share the same blockchain as everyone else.',
        "This is comparable to early application-specific blockchains like Bitcoin and Litecoin where each chain only served a single purpose. Next shared hosting enabled developers to utilize a single server to launch websites",

        "This one is wonderful and free",

        "Yeah you have a great point. I think it's just sometimes disheartening to see the disconnect between the state of where things are today vs the messaging put out there by many leaders in the community around accessibility and equality. I personally think it makes sense to support",
        "would love to know more details about this stuff but have not been able to get any clear answers to things like how long proofs to L1 can be delayed, as well as a ballpark estimate of TX cost once ZK rollups are used at scale, both before and after sharding",
        "So you're saying the cost of the underlying settlement layer does not affect the transaction cost at all? so if transaction cost goes up by 1000x then there is no additional cost to the ZK L2s batching to the L1? Genuinely curious, similar conversation:",
        "Great question, I don't know and no one seems to be able to answer this question, so I think it makes sense to support everything happening right now to scale Ethereum while also supporting those experimenting outside of the ecosystem. May the best solution win.",
        "I'm both extremely excited about and bullish on ZK L2s, while somewhat wary of the time frame of sharding given what we've seen with POS, and also exploring other chains. I enjoy hearing a lot of feedback from conversations like this and think they are healthy.",
        "It definitely seems that the future of ETH scalability is a combination of ZK L2s + sharding, and I'm also excited to see experimentation and innovation outside of the ETH ecosystem, will continue to be a fun place to work in for the foreseeable future. thanks for the answer!",
        "Excited for L2 adoption, especially ZK",
        "I think we need more nuanced and educated discussions, period, there is definitely too much wishful thinking but already a lot of wins and improvements that are already (mostly) working today",
        "I get it, as an Ethereum user I'm not supposed to criticize the cult. Here's what I think - fuck maximalism.",
        "A large number of the people I talk to about web3 can't afford an ENS domain. People are selling ENS as the future of identity, but locking out the large majority of the population of the world. Is it because they are ignorant, or is it because they genuinely lack empathy?",
        "yes, bullish on (and a fan of) both",
        "I want no part in the former, and have realized that the most toxic communities out there usually are ok with them playing a large part in theirs.",
        "There seems to be a crowd that is ok with high transaction fees and that ‚Äúpoor people‚Äù (99.9% of the world by their definition) do not deserve to take part in web3, a crowd who think is that inclusion is a core tenet of web3, and of course a lot in between.",
        "I think ultimately we want ultra cheap transactions (less than a penny or so), decentralization, and high availability, I think we'll get there in some way it will just take time, unsure where this will happen though, could be ETH ecosystem could be somewhere else.",
        "For Ethereum in particular, if the price of the underlying batch transaction goes up by 200x or so for hours on end, how is this mitigated by an L2? Does the L2 simply not post for that time period? Or is that cost distributed over time? If so what is the variance?",
        "I think that rethinking the monolithic approach to blockchains is a great start, there are a few protocols already doing this, also Ethereum is moving in this direction, it will just all take some time.",
        "I've spent over 90+% of my time in web3 building on and teaching Ethereum and its ecosystem, and I love most of the people and builders in this space and want it to continue to succeed.",
        "I'm excited for sharding and any innovation on Ethereum as it (and it's ecosystem) is what I've spent 90+% of my time building on, but also excited to see innovation in other paradigms like modular chains. Also who knows how many years it will take for sharding to be a reality.",
        "I understand, but if the cost of the underlying chain is 100 - 500x because of a spike in usage, then the batch commit is therefore 100 - 500x more expensive. Unless the L2 can function without posting for a few hours and still function properly, is this the case?",
        "I'm excited to see a lot more adoption and innovation with L2s and L3, especially ZK, and to see how it plays out, but am also excited to see experimentation with other completely different non-monolithic approaches, it will continue to be an exciting space to be in :)",
        "So my thinking is: 1. for my own vision of what web3 is, transactions should be less than a penny 2. in the future, at the scale of tens of millions of transactions per second, will these batch transactions also clog the network?",
        "Hey, yes! They are here:",
        "good point, and interesting to know, how long of a window is the waiting period?",
        "Understood, but the rollup transaction itself is variable to the underlying chain, so the L2 transaction costs will go down with more usage but posting back to the L1 is still dependent on the gas cost there.",
        "I guess my thinking is that if traffic spike can increase gas costs by 100x+ or so, then costs of the l2s running on top of it will also increase by the same amount, so that does not seem scalable in the long term, imagine these prices x100 or more when traffic is high",
        "It‚Äôs also bearish as fuck that so few people publicly criticize the current shortcomings of the space, and so many people attack those voicing a genuine opinion, it‚Äôs ok to criticize,we‚Äôre all trying to improve ourselves and the technologies we care about",
        "Nothing that innovative happening with 99% of L1s but there are some interesting approaches like  which take an entirely different approach",
        "If it costs a penny or more to transact it‚Äôs too expensive, at least that‚Äôs what we should be aiming for.",
        "If we‚Äôre using rollups then why not just use a different chain altogether that is not limited to the constraints of the underlying L1, especially in the future when we‚Äôll see more and more innovation happening?",
        "Not interested anymore in V2, have moved on tbh",
        "L2s inherit the the underlying price of their L1 and, to me, are not the answer in the long run (though will help for now)",
        "Rollups to any L1 will still reflect the price of the underlying network, thinking approaches like what  is a better way",
        "an ungodly amount of resources are being locked into a chain that 99.99% of the worlds population will simply not have access to, this is not what I signed up for and why I‚Äôm certain the monolithic approach to building blockchain networks is not the way forward",
        "the current gas prices are bearish as fuck for Ethereum and every person who even tries to argue otherwise makes me even more bearish on all of this shit, the level of mental gymnastics people go through to justify this shit is sickening",
